### PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

"Novel Month" is an application for someone who possibly wrote a novel during national novel writing  month and would like to learn how novels are structured but doesn’t have a lot of time.

The application will help the user know intuitively how novels are structured with out getting overwhelmed. She will also receive immediate feedback from IBM Watson’s Tone Analyzer on the emotional range of her writing.

### FEATURES:
Novel Month is an isomorphic application, which allows for better SEO and faster load times.

This is the work area. The Wizard of Oz has been broken up into 24 pieces. If the user would like to finish a novel in a month she can finish one piece a day. Each of these pieces are also broken up into three micro pieces so that if the user would like to take her time she can focus on one micro piece at a time.

The Sentences high in certain emotions are highlighted in different colors. The user is able to see at a glance the emotional range of the piece. She can also click on each sentence to see how likely it contains each emotion.

After she reads the original piece and writing tips such as what part of the hero’s journey this piece is a part of she can enter her own writing.

The database is set up to accept as many versions of this micro piece that the user would like to create. One of my next features is to display all of these versions, which I think will be very useful and allow the user the freedom to create without worrying about getting it right the first time.
